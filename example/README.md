# ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter Toolkit examples

A series of example apps that demonstrate how to use the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Flutter Toolkit.

An example exists for each component within the toolkit.

## Required steps before running the example viewer

From the `example` directory, run:

```
dart run arcgis_maps install
```

See lib/main.dart for an example viewer application that enables navigation between the different examples.

The example code uses ArcGIS Location Platform basemaps, which can be accessed with an API key access token. Set your access token in the `main()` function.

For additional information including how to get an access token, see: https://developers.arcgis.com/flutter/

### Running individual examples

After following the required steps above, you can also run individual examples if desired from their corresponding `.dart` files, which all contain a `main()` function.
